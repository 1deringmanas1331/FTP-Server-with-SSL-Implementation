# Secure FTP Server 
 This is a Secure FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server implementation with various features aimed at ensuring secure and efficient file transfer. The server incorporates authentication, directory listing, uploading, downloading, and a safe quit mechanism. Additionally, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption is implemented to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of user details and transferred data. 

# Features are :
### 1. <ins>Authentication:</ins> Users are required to authenticate themselves before accessing the server's functionalities, ensuring secure access control.
        
### 2. <ins>Directory Listing:</ins> Users can list the contents of directories on the server, providing an organized view of available files and directories.

### 3. <ins>Uploading:</ins> Users can upload files to the server, facilitating easy transfer of data from their local machines to the server(in many formats including gif,png,mp4,jpeg,jpg,word,pptx,text etc.).

### 4. <ins>Downloading:</ins> Users can download files from the server to their local machines, enabling retrieval of necessary data(in many formats including gif,png,mp4,jpeg,jpg,word,pptx,text etc.).

### 5. <ins>Quitting Out:</ins> A safe quit mechanism is provided for users to exit the server gracefully, ensuring proper termination of connections and processes.

### 6. <ins>SSL Encryption:</ins> SSL encryption is implemented to encrypt data transmitted between the server and clients, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transferred information.
